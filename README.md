# Unused exports in TypsScript

This extension wraps and provides VSCode GUI for the [ts-prune](https://github.com/nadeesha/ts-prune) tool.

Current implementation is simple and naive. It expects to find a `tsconfig.json` in the first workspace root folder. To get the list of unused exports hit the Refresh button. The extension does not track file changes, nor it updates the results list automatically.

Enjoy!)
